# ProjectEuler-6-Python

Here is a solution I wrote in Python 3 for a coding problem I solved on HackerRank as part of a series of coding problems called Project Euler

# Problem 

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1+2+...+10)^2= 55^2 = 3025. Hence the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025-385=2640.

Find the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first  natural numbers and the square of the sum.
